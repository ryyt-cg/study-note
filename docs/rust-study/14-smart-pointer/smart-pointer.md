# Smart Pointer

In Rust, a smart pointer is a class that wraps a raw pointer and provides additional functionality.

## Box

Box is a smart pointer that points to heap-allocated data. It is used:

* when you have a fixed size data that you want to store on the heap.
* when you have a large amount of data, and you want to transfer ownership but ensure that the data is not copied.
* when you have a data structure that is recursive, and you want to store it on the heap.
* when you have a trait object rather than a struct, and you want to store it on the heap.

```rust
use std::mem;

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
struct Point {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
}

// A Rectangle can be specified by where its top left and bottom right 
// corners are in space
#[allow(dead_code)]
struct Rectangle {
    top_left: Point,
    bottom_right: Point,
}

fn origin() -> Point {
    Point { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 }
}

fn boxed_origin() -> Box<Point> {
    // Allocate this point on the heap, and return a pointer to it
    Box::new(Point { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 })
}

fn main() {
    // (all the type annotations are superfluous)
    // Stack allocated variables
    let point: Point = origin();
    let rectangle: Rectangle = Rectangle {
        top_left: origin(),
        bottom_right: Point { x: 3.0, y: -4.0 }
    };

    // Heap allocated rectangle
    let boxed_rectangle: Box<Rectangle> = Box::new(Rectangle {
        top_left: origin(),
        bottom_right: Point { x: 3.0, y: -4.0 },
    });

    // The output of functions can be boxed
    let boxed_point: Box<Point> = Box::new(origin());

    // Double indirection
    let box_in_a_box: Box<Box<Point>> = Box::new(boxed_origin());

    println!("Point occupies {} bytes on the stack",
             mem::size_of_val(&point));
    println!("Rectangle occupies {} bytes on the stack",
             mem::size_of_val(&rectangle));

    // box size == pointer size
    println!("Boxed point occupies {} bytes on the stack",
             mem::size_of_val(&boxed_point));
    println!("Boxed rectangle occupies {} bytes on the stack",
             mem::size_of_val(&boxed_rectangle));
    println!("Boxed box occupies {} bytes on the stack",
             mem::size_of_val(&box_in_a_box));

    // Copy the data contained in `boxed_point` into `unboxed_point`
    let unboxed_point: Point = *boxed_point;
    println!("Unboxed point occupies {} bytes on the stack",
             mem::size_of_val(&unboxed_point));
}
```

Recursive data structure example:

```rust
// Compiler error: recursive type `List` has infinite size, therefore Box<T> is needed.
enum List {
    // Cons(i32, List), // Compiler error
    Cons(i32, Box<List>),
    Nil,
}

use List::{Cons, Nil};

fn main() {
    let list = List::Cons(1, Box::new(List::Cons(2, Box::new(List::Nil))));
}
```

## Deref

## Rc

Rc is a reference counting smart pointer. It is used when you want to have multiple ownership of a value. Rc is a
non-atomic reference counting smart pointer. It is not thread safe. If you want to use Rc in a multi-threaded
environment, you should use Arc instead.

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
    let rc_examples = "Rc examples".to_string();
    {
        println!("--- rc_a is created ---");

        let rc_a: Rc<String> = Rc::new(rc_examples);
        println!("Reference Count of rc_a: {}", Rc::strong_count(&rc_a));

        {
            println!("--- rc_a is cloned to rc_b ---");

            let rc_b: Rc<String> = Rc::clone(&rc_a);
            println!("Reference Count of rc_b: {}", Rc::strong_count(&rc_b));
            println!("Reference Count of rc_a: {}", Rc::strong_count(&rc_a));

            // Two `Rc`s are equal if their inner values are equal
            println!("rc_a and rc_b are equal: {}", rc_a.eq(&rc_b));

            // We can use methods of a value directly
            println!("Length of the value inside rc_a: {}", rc_a.len());
            println!("Value of rc_b: {}", rc_b);

            println!("--- rc_b is dropped out of scope ---");
        }

        println!("Reference Count of rc_a: {}", Rc::strong_count(&rc_a));

        println!("--- rc_a is dropped out of scope ---");
    }

    // Error! `rc_examples` already moved into `rc_a`
    // And when `rc_a` is dropped, `rc_examples` is dropped together
    // println!("rc_examples: {}", rc_examples);
    // TODO ^ Try uncommenting this line
}
```

## Arc

Arc is an atomic reference counting smart pointer. It is used when you want to have multiple ownership of a value in a
multi-threaded environment.

```rust
use std::time::Duration;
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    // This variable declaration is where its value is specified.
    let apple = Arc::new("the same apple");

    for _ in 0..10 {
        // Here there is no value specification as it is a pointer to a
        // reference in the memory heap.
        let apple = Arc::clone(&apple);

        thread::spawn(move || {
            // As Arc was used, threads can be spawned using the value allocated
            // in the Arc variable pointer's location.
            println!("{:?}", apple);
        });
    }

    // Make sure all Arc instances are printed from spawned threads.
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));
}
```

## RefCell

A RefCell is another way to change values without needing to declare mut.
It means "reference cell," and is like a Cell but uses references instead of copies.

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct User {
    id: u32,
    year_registered: u32,
    username: String,
    active: RefCell<bool>,
    // Many other fields
}

fn main() {
    let user_1 = User {
        id: 1,
        year_registered: 2020,
        username: "User 1".to_string(),
        active: RefCell::new(true),
    };

    println!("{:?}", user_1.active);
}
```
