# Defining and Instantiating Structs

## Defining struct

* Use the struct keyword
* Give the struct name, starting with a capital
* Define field names and types

```rust
struct User {
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
    active: bool,
}
```

Instantiating struct

```rust
struct User {
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
    active: bool,
}

fn main() {
    let user1 = User {
        email: String::from("someone@examples.com"),
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
}

```

To get a specific value from a struct, we can use dot notation. If we wanted just this userâ€™s email address, we can use
user1.email wherever we want to use this value. If the instance is mutable, we can change a value by using the dot
notation and assigning into a particular field. Listing 5-3 shows how to change the value in the email field of a
mutable User instance:

```rust
struct User {
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
    active: bool,
}

fn main() {
    let mut user1 = User {
        email: String::from("someone@examples.com"),
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
    user1.email = String::from("anotheremail@examples.com");
    z
}

```

build_user function that returns a User instance with the given email and username. The active field gets the value of
true, and the sign_in_count gets a value of 1.

```rust
struct User {
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
    active: bool,
}

fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        email: email,
        username: username,
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}
```

## Passing struct parameters by value

It depends on struct implementing Copy trait or not

* if implementing Copy trait
    * a bitwise copy of the struct is passed to the called function
    * The caller retains ownership and can use the struct afterwards
* if not implementing Copy trait
    * Ownership of the struct is moved to the called function
    * The caller loses ownership and can't use the struct afterwards

```rust
use crate::my_types::Employee;

pub fn do_it() {
    println!("\nIn demo_struct_pass_value::do_it()");

    let e1 = Employee {
        name: String::from("John"),
        salary: 1000,
        fulltime: false,
    };

    // Pass struct by value (and move ownership into the function).
    consume_employee(e1);

    // Can't use e1 now...
    // println!("{}", e1.name);
}

fn consume_employee(e: Employee) {
    println!(
        "{} earns {}, fulltime status: {}",
        e.name, e.salary, e.fulltime
    );
} // Employee object dropped here.
```

## Passing struct parameters as by reference

```rust
use crate::mytypes::Employee;

pub fn do_it() {
    println!("\nIn demo_struct_pass_reference::do_it()");

    let mut e1 = Employee {
        name: String::from("Jane"),
        salary: 1000,
        fulltime: true,
    };

    // Pass struct by reference.
    print_employee(&e1);

    // Pass struct by mutable reference.
    reward_employee(&mut e1);
    print_employee(&e1);
}

fn print_employee(e: &Employee) {
    println!(
        "Using explicit dereferencing: {} earns {}, fulltime status: {}",
        (*e).name,
        (*e).salary,
        (*e).fulltime
    );
    println!(
        "Using implicit dereferencing: {} earns {}, fulltime status: {}",
        e.name, e.salary, e.fulltime
    );
}

fn reward_employee(e: &mut Employee) {
    // Using explicit dereferencing.
    (*e).salary += 500;

    // Using implicit dereferencing.
    e.salary += 250;
}
```

## Return struct as value

```rust
use crate::mytypes::Employee;

pub fn do_it() {
    println!("\nIn demo_struct_return_value::do_it()");

    let e1 = build_employee(String::from("Jane"), 1000, true);
    print_employee(&e1);

    let mut e2 = build_employee_v2(String::from("John"), 1000, false);
    e2.salary += 750;
    print_employee(&e2);
}

fn build_employee(name: String, salary: u64, fulltime: bool) -> Employee {
    Employee {
        name: name,
        salary: salary,
        fulltime: fulltime,
    }
}

fn build_employee_v2(name: String, salary: u64, fulltime: bool) -> Employee {
    Employee {
        name,
        salary,
        fulltime,
    }
}

fn print_employee(emp: &Employee) {
    println!(
        "{} earns {}, fulltime status: {}",
        emp.name, emp.salary, emp.fulltime
    );
}
```

## Return struct as reference

* <'a> is a lifetime annotation, letter a can be anything name, like b, c or z.
* We apply 'a to each reference param to indicate that they have the same lifetime.

```rust
use crate::mytypes::Employee;

pub fn do_it() {
    println!("\nIn demo_struct_return_reference::do_it()");

    let mut e1 = build_employee(String::from("Jane"), 1001, true);
    let mut e2 = build_employee(String::from("John"), 1000, false);

    let ri = choose_employee(&e1, &e2);
    print_employee(ri);

    let rm = choose_mut_employee(&mut e1, &mut e2);
    rm.salary *= 2;
    print_employee(rm);
}

fn build_employee(name: String, salary: u64, fulltime: bool) -> Employee {
    Employee {
        name,
        salary,
        fulltime,
    }
}

fn choose_employee<'a>(e1: &'a Employee, e2: &'a Employee) -> &'a Employee {
    if e1.salary > e2.salary {
        e1
    } else {
        e2
    }
}

fn choose_mut_employee<'a>(e1: &'a mut Employee, e2: &'a mut Employee) -> &'a mut Employee {
    if e1.salary > e2.salary {
        e1
    } else {
        e2
    }
}

fn print_employee(e: &Employee) {
    println!(
        "{} earns {}, fulltime status: {}",
        e.name, e.salary, e.fulltime
    );
} 
```
