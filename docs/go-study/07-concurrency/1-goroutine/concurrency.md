goroutines - to execute tasks independently, potentially in parallel
channels - for communication, synchronization between goroutines

```go
package main

func main() {
   tasks := getTasks()

   // Process each task.
   for _, task := range tasks {
      process(task)
   }
   
}
```

### WaitGroup

WaitGroup is a great way to wait for a set of concurrent operations to complete when you either donâ€™t care about the
result of the concurrent operation, or you have other means of collecting their results. If neither of those
conditions are true, I suggest you use channels and a select statement instead.

You can think of a WaitGroup like a concurrent-safe counter: calls to Add increment the counter by the integer passed
in, and calls to Done decrements the counter by one. Calls to Wait block until the counter is zero.

### Mutex @ RWMutex

Mutex stands for "mutual exclusion" and is a way to guard critical sections of your program. Mutex creates a share
memory and provides a synchronized access to that memory.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

func main() {
	var count int
	var lock sync.Mutex

	increment := func() {
		lock.Lock()
		defer lock.Unlock()
		count++
		fmt.Printf("Incrementing: %d\n", count)
	}

	decrement := func() {
		lock.Lock()
		defer lock.Unlock()
		count--
		fmt.Printf("Decrementing: %d\n", count)
	}

	// Increment
	var arithmetic sync.WaitGroup
	for i := 0; i <= 5; i++ {
		arithmetic.Add(1)
		go func() {
			defer arithmetic.Done()
			increment()
		}()
	}

	// Decrement
	for i := 0; i <= 5; i++ {
		arithmetic.Add(1)
		go func() {
			defer arithmetic.Done()
			decrement()
		}()
	}
	arithmetic.Wait()
	fmt.Println("Arithmetic complete.")
}
```

#### channels are

* goroutine-safe
* store and pass values between goroutines
* provide FIFO semantics
* can cause goroutines to block and unblock

#### making channels

buffered channel

```go
ch := make(chan Task, 3)
```

unbuffered channel

```go
ch := make(chan Task)

```

Send and Receive

G1

```go
package main;

func main() {
   ...
   for _, task := range tasks {
      taskCh <- task
   }
}
```

G2

```go
func worker() {
   for {
      task := <-taskCh
      process(task)
   }
}
```
