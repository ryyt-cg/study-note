# Reflection

Reflection is the ability of a program to introspect and analyze its structure during run-time. In Go language,
reflection is primarily carried out with types. The reflect package offers all the required APIs/Methods for this
purpose. Reflection is often termed as a method of metaprogramming.

Clear is better than clever. Reflection is never clear.

Reflection is a very powerful and advanced concept in Go, and it should be used with care. It is very difficult to
write clear and maintainable code using reflection. It should be avoided wherever possible and should be used only when
necessary.
